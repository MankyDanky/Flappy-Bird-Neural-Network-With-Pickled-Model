# Flappy Bird Neural Network w/ Pickled Genome
 Thanks to TechWithTim on YT, who is the guy that made the course I followed to make this project. If you are trying to learn about machine learning, and already have atleast a base understanding of python then check him out. This Project was essentially what he covers and has on his github, but with a pre-trained model that has been pickled.
