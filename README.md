# Flappy Bird Neural Network w/ Pickled Genome
This project was covered by TechWithTim. Link To Original Project: https://github.com/techwithtim/NEAT-Flappy-Bird/blob/master/flappy_bird.py
At the end of Tim's course he said to try and pickle the ai and save it, and so I did. Thanks to TechWithTim on YT for teaching me how to make my first neural network using NEAT.
